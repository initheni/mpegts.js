In this article, we will show you how to download COMSOL Multiphysics for free from the official website[^1^], how to use it for basic and advanced simulations with the help of an online course[^2^], and how to find free alternatives to COMSOL Multiphysics for specific applications[^3^]. By the end of this article, you will be able to use COMSOL Multiphysics for free and enhance your skills and knowledge in physics simulations.
  
## How to Download COMSOL Multiphysics for Free
 
The first step to use COMSOL Multiphysics for free is to download it from the official website. To do this, you will need an on-subscription COMSOL license attached to your COMSOL Access account or a software trial provided by your sales representative. Trial licenses are automatically associated with your account. If you do not yet have a COMSOL Access account, you can create one for free on the website.
 
Once you have logged into your COMSOL Access account, you can go to the product download page[^1^] and choose the version of COMSOL Multiphysics that you want to download. The latest version as of April 2023 is 6.1.0.346, which was released on March 14, 2023. You can also download COMSOL Serverâ¢, which is a software that allows you to run and distribute applications created with COMSOL Multiphysics.
 
After you have downloaded the software, you can install it on your computer by following the instructions on the screen. You will need to enter your license information or trial code during the installation process. Once the installation is complete, you can launch COMSOL Multiphysics and start using it for free.
  
## How to Use COMSOL Multiphysics for Free
 
Now that you have downloaded and installed COMSOL Multiphysics for free, you may wonder how to use it effectively. COMSOL Multiphysics is a very versatile and comprehensive software that can handle various types of physics simulations, such as fluid dynamics, heat transfer, electromagnetics, acoustics, structural mechanics, chemical reactions, and more. However, it also has a steep learning curve and requires some background knowledge in physics and mathematics.
 
If you are a beginner in physics simulations or want to refresh your skills and knowledge, we recommend taking an online course that teaches you the basics of COMSOL Multiphysics. One such course is "COMSOL Multiphysics simulation 2023 : Basics to Advanced" by Bibhatsu Kuiri on Udemy[^2^]. This course covers the following topics:
 
- Basic concepts on simulations, boundary conditions, meshing, results
- How to create a 3D model for simulation
- How to add physics and boundary conditions in simulation
- How to run basic simulations for your problem
- How to use simulations for your research and understanding
- Analysis of simulation data
- How to verify simulation data
- COMSOL Basics
- Thermal Modelling
- Equation-based Modelling

The course also includes quizzes, assignments, live demonstrations, interactive concept building, and 1v1 support from the instructor. The course is suitable for researchers, PhD students, chemists, physicists, engineers, and anyone who wants to learn how to use COMSOL Multiphysics for free.
